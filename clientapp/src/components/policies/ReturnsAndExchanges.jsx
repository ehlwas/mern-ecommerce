            <p>Welcome to Agoy Sleep Experience. We're delighted to have you as a valued customer. Below, you'll 
            find our Returns and Exchange Policy, designed to ensure your shopping experience with us is as smooth 
            and satisfying as possible.</p>
            <p className="mont-bold">Returns Policy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>30-Day Return Period: We offer a 30-day return period from the date of delivery. If you're unsatisfied with your purchase for any reason, you can initiate a return within this timeframe</li>
                <li>Original Condition: To be eligible for a return, the mattress must be in its original, unopened 
                packaging and in unused condition. We understand that trying out a mattress is essential, so we offer a 
                one-time exception for a return of a used mattress within the 30-day period.</li>
                <li>Return Process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact Customer Support: Reach out to our customer support team via email or phone to initiate 
                        the return process</li>
                        <li>Return Authorization: Once your return is authorized, you'll receive instructions on how to proceed, 
                        including details about packaging and shipping.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Return Costs: While we strive to provide the best service, return shipping costs will be the 
                responsibility of the customer. However, if the return is due to a manufacturing defect or an error on 
                our part, we'll cover the return shipping costs.</li>
                <li>Refund: Once we receive and inspect the returned mattress, we'll process your refund. Refunds will 
                be issued to the original payment method used during purchase. Please allow 7-10 business days for the 
                refund to reflect in your account.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mont-bold">Exchange Policy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>30-Day Exchange Period: We offer a 30-day exchange period from the date of delivery. If you're 
                looking to exchange your mattress for a different model or size, you can initiate an exchange within this 
                timeframe.</li>
                <li>Original Condition: Similar to returns, the mattress for exchange must be in its original, unopened 
                packaging and in unused condition. We allow a one-time exchange for a mattress that has been used 
                within the 30-day period.</li>
                <li>Exchange Process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact Customer Support: Get in touch with our customer support team via email or phone to start 
                        the exchange process.</li>
                        <li>Exchange Authorization: Once your exchange is authorized, you'll receive instructions on how to 
                        proceed, including details about packaging and shipping the original mattress back to us.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Exchange Costs: Customers are responsible for covering the return shipping costs of the original 
                mattress and any price difference for the new mattress, if applicable</li>
                <li>New Mattress Delivery: Once we receive the original mattress and verify its condition, we'll arrange 
                for the delivery of your new mattress. Delivery times may vary based on your location.</li>
            </ol>

            customers. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our customer support
